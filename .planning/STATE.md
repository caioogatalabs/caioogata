## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Design system (Figma + CSS tokens) is complete and validated -- not in roadmap scope
- [Init]: V1 must be preserved before any destructive changes (branch + deploy)
- [Init]: Dark-only at launch, EN-only at launch
- [Phase 01]: Token architecture: two-layer system (primitives + semantic @theme) for Tailwind v4 integration
- [Phase 01]: Fabio XM loaded as single variable font @font-face covering weights 300-900
- [Phase 02]: V2 section stubs in src/components/sections/v2/ to isolate from V1 components
- [Phase 02]: StickyHeader rendered inside IntroSection fragment for clean DOM order
- [Phase 02]: Reduced motion for inline styles uses useRef with window.matchMedia check
- [Phase 02]: Reused existing /api/contact Resend route for V2 contact form
- [Phase 02]: Separated hoveredIndex from activeIndex for independent mouse/keyboard highlight tracking in useMenuNavigation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Fabio XM is trial version -- verify license before production deployment
