## Professional Summary

I lead design teams at the intersection of brand strategy and technical implementation. Twenty years in Art Direction—fifteen focused on UI—building digital experiences for brands like Petrobras, O Boticario, and Azion taught me that great design bridges business goals with user needs—and that the best solutions come from questioning assumptions and iterating fearlessly.

I'm a Design Director based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, with over 20 years in Art Direction—15 of those specifically focused on User Interface design—creating digital experiences at the intersection of brand strategy and developer tools.

I've led design teams at Azion (as Design Director, Brand Experience Director, and Developer Experience Director), where I built a 14-person design organization and implemented two design systems from the ground up. Before that, I joined Huia from day one and eventually became a Partner at the design and technology studio, which grew to around 40 employees before being acquired by Stefanini.

My work spans iconic Brazilian brands including Petrobras, O Boticario, Tramontina, Sicredi, and Ache Group, as well as international clients like Mondelez (Lacta, Bis, Toblerone, Oreo).

## Life Outside Design

I'm a triathlete, training 10-14 hours per week across running, cycling, and swimming. The discipline of athletic training—waking at 5 AM for a two-hour run, then putting in a full workday—teaches you to manage energy, focus on what matters, and push through discomfort.

Video games have been a lifelong passion and a major influence on my design work. I've always looked at games as inspiration—particularly for visual references and interaction design. The attention to detail in game UI/UX, the storytelling through visuals, and the immersive experiences have shaped how I approach digital product design.

Before design consumed my life, music did. I played bass in INFUSE, a melodic punk rock band. I'm a cinephile who watches every Oscar nominee each year (favorite directors: Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Almodovar, Scorsese, Nolan, Villeneuve).

I'm also a three-time Brazilian vice-champion in youth baseball categories, played volleyball at the state championship level at 17, and surfed for years. I'm an INTP—analytical, curious, always questioning. I work to balance my natural tendency to question everything with the need to ship and execute.
