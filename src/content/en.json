As I wrote in 2018: \"In Judo, the first lessons are all focused on teaching how to fall. From the beginning, it's understood that you will fall, lose, err. So suffer less, lose the fear, preserve your body and, most importantly, prepare your mind for the obstacles ahead.\"\n\nYears later, skateboarding taught me the same lesson. Skateboarders are the most persistent people I've ever met. They fall hundreds of times perfecting a single trick, and they do it without fear because falling is part of the process.\n\nThis mindset translates directly to design. The best work comes from teams that aren't afraid to test, fail, and iterate. Ship early, get feedback, evolve. Great products aren't born perfect—they're refined through countless small improvements.\n\nAs a design leader, I try to create environments where teams can fall safely. Where iteration is celebrated, not feared. Where \"I don't know yet\" is an acceptable answer, as long as it's followed by curiosity and action."

The discipline of athletic training—waking at 5 AM for a two-hour run, then putting in a full workday—teaches you to manage energy, focus on what matters, and push through discomfort.\n\nVideo games have been a lifelong passion and a major influence on my design work. I've always looked at games as inspiration—particularly for visual references and interaction design. The attention to detail in game UI/UX, the storytelling through visuals, and the immersive experiences have shaped how I approach digital product design.\n\nBefore design consumed my life, music did. I played bass in INFUSE, a melodic punk rock band. I'm a cinephile who watches every Oscar nominee each year (favorite directors: Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Almodovar, Scorsese, Nolan, Villeneuve).\n\nI'm also a three-time Brazilian vice-champion in youth baseball categories, played volleyball at the state championship level at 17, and surfed for years. I'm an INTP—analytical, curious, always questioning. I work to balance my natural tendency to question everything with the need to ship and execute."
