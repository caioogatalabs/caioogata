    "bio": "My work bridges brand strategy, product craft, and technical implementation — designing and building at the intersection of design systems, developer experience, and product engineering, where craft and technical rigor reinforce each other rather than compete.\n\nThe most significant output of that approach is the Azion Console Kit — a complete front-end rebuild of a cloud platform's management interface, now open source and in production at Itaú, Magazine Luiza, and Netshoes. Built on Vue 3, TypeScript, and a headless component architecture, it reduced new screen implementation time from days to hours. That project is the closest thing I have to a statement of method: end-to-end ownership, from design system to shipped production code, with 6,000+ commits and 34+ contributors.\n\nAt Azion Technologies I held three progressive roles over four years — Design Director, Brand Experience Director, and Developer Experience Director. Comfortable operating at both strategic and tactical levels, I built the design organization from scratch, established design-thinking culture and discovery practices, created Azion Design, led the company's full rebranding, and eventually took ownership of the entire user-facing engineering layer: Console, CLI, developer tools, the public website, technical documentation, and marketing landing pages. The system was built around components and templates that gave each vertical team full autonomy to ship — without design becoming a bottleneck.\n\nBefore Azion, I was at Huia — a full-service creative technology studio that grew to around 40 people before being acquired by Stefanini. The work went well beyond conventional digital production: we built with WebGL, facial recognition APIs, motion and animation when video was becoming a primary medium on the web, and LLM-adjacent techniques when those were genuinely experimental. Strong creative direction skills, with the ability to be hands on when needed — the client list ran from Petrobras, O Boticário, Tramontina, and Sicredi to Mondelez brands like Lacta, Bis, and Toblerone.\n\nWhat drives me is the problem of translation — not as a bureaucratic exercise, but as a creative one. Technology is never the starting point and never the barrier. The starting point is always the idea: the desire to transform something into an experience that's memorable, well-crafted, and actually useful. Engineering rigor and design craft aren't opposites. The best products I've been part of happened when both disciplines agreed on that.",

    "body": "Great design comes from the same place as great athleticism: the willingness to fail, learn, and iterate.\n\nI learned this first on the Judo mat. As I wrote in 2018: \"In Judo, the first lessons are all focused on teaching how to fall. From the beginning, it's understood that you will fall, lose, err. So suffer less, lose the fear, preserve your body and, most importantly, prepare your mind for the obstacles ahead.\"\n\nYears later, skateboarding taught me the same lesson. Skateboarders are the most persistent people I've ever met. They fall hundreds of times perfecting a single trick, and they do it without fear because falling is part of the process.\n\nThis mindset translates directly to design. The best work comes from teams that aren't afraid to test, fail, and iterate. Ship early, get feedback, evolve. Great products aren't born perfect—they're refined through countless small improvements.\n\nAs a design leader, I try to create environments where teams can fall safely. Where iteration is celebrated, not feared. Where \"I don't know yet\" is an acceptable answer, as long as it's followed by curiosity and action."

    "body": "I'm a triathlete, training 10-14 hours per week across running, cycling, and swimming. The discipline of athletic training—waking at 5 AM for a two-hour run, then putting in a full workday—teaches you to manage energy, focus on what matters, and push through discomfort.\n\nVideo games have been a lifelong passion and a major influence on my design work. I've always looked at games as inspiration—particularly for visual references and interaction design. The attention to detail in game UI/UX, the storytelling through visuals, and the immersive experiences have shaped how I approach digital product design.\n\nBefore design consumed my life, music did. I played bass in INFUSE, a melodic punk rock band. I'm a cinephile who watches every Oscar nominee each year (favorite directors: Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Almodovar, Scorsese, Nolan, Villeneuve).\n\nI'm also a three-time Brazilian vice-champion in youth baseball categories, played volleyball at the state championship level at 17, and surfed for years. I'm an INTP—analytical, curious, always questioning. I work to balance my natural tendency to question everything with the need to ship and execute."
