As I wrote in 2018: \"In Judo, the first lessons are all focused on teaching how to fall. From the beginning, it's understood that you will fall, lose, err. So suffer less, lose the fear, preserve your body and, most importantly, prepare your mind for the obstacles ahead.\"\n\nYears later, skateboarding taught me the same lesson. Skateboarders are the most persistent people I've ever met. They fall hundreds of times perfecting a single trick, and they do it without fear because falling is part of the process.\n\nThis mindset translates directly to design. The best work comes from teams that aren't afraid to test, fail, and iterate. Ship early, get feedback, evolve. Great products aren't born perfect—they're refined through countless small improvements.\n\nAs a design leader, I try to create environments where teams can fall safely. Where iteration is celebrated, not feared. Where \"I don't know yet\" is an acceptable answer, as long as it's followed by curiosity and action."
